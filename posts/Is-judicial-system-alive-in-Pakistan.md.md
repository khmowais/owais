On Feb 26th 2025, the Punjab government launched [**Crime Control Department (CCD)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Control_Department), a special wing of the Punjab Police created by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to tackle serious and organized crime in the province. In just six months of operation, CCD has reportedly killed over **600 alleged criminals**, many of them individuals with long lists of FIRs who had for years evaded the courts without ever being convicted. It has been given the authority to establish its own "Police" stations, register FIRs and operate with a degree of independence that makes it exactly a parallel force. And it is being praised for doing what citizens believe the justice system failed to do for decades: act swiftly, decisively and without delay. Ordinary citizens have welcomed this move with relief and even celebration. For the first time in years, they say "the streets feel safer". Some notorious figures have gone into hiding while others have been fried meaning “taken care of.” The public long accustomed to fear and impunity, now sees visible results. And the government of course enjoys the popularity that comes with such a display of power and efficiency. 
But beneath this surface calm lies a disturbing question: **does this sudden dependence on an armed department of “swift justice” reflect a deeper loss of faith in the judicial system itself?** For decades, Pakistan’s courts have been a symbol of delay rather than justice. It's common wisdom that if you file a case and fight it fairly, your grandchildren might still be waiting for the verdict. This inefficiency has given rise to _Panchayat_ and _Jirga_ systems that deliver instant, if imperfect justice. They operate with state’s or even their own legal framework but have the advantage of immediacy and cultural understanding. A Jirga elder knows what it means for a poor farmer to lose a goat or a half a Marla of land. His can see human desperation where a court might only see paperwork, Meanwhile the Court’s Marie Antoinettes believing “Qu'ils mangent de la brioche!" often fail to grasp the realities of rural poverty.

In that light, CCD is not a revolution but an admission, public confession that the judiciary is no longer trusted to do its job. If even the government must create an alternative to the courts, then what remains of the rule of law? A state cannot exist without a functioning judiciary, it becomes merely a collection of armed departments acting under temporary moral approval. I am not arguing against the need to control crime or to make citizens feel safe. These are legitimate goals and people have every right to demand them. But there is a line between _justice_ and _vengeance_ and now the state has crosses it, i believe the consequences will spread quietly but deeply. When killings happen outside the courts whether by mobs or by official order and no court takes notice of it, the judiciary’s credibility erodes further. And once people see that the system outside the courts “works” faster and delivers results, they will never want to return to the old, slow process, here is the real danger. The moment people start believing that justice is something to be delivered by force rather than by law, the state begins to unravel. Today it's a department doing the killing, tomorrow it will be individuals, mobs or political groups taking matters into their own hands. Once the people learn that might equals justice, the government will find it impossible to unteach that lesson.

Pakistan’s judiciary is imperfect and perhaps even broken but it is still the only mechanism capable of offering legitimate justice under the rule of law. Reforming it will take time, effort and political will, none of which come with applause or instant headlines. But if we replace it with institutions that act outside the law, we are not fixing the system; we are writing its obituary. So, is the judicial system alive in Pakistan? Technically, yes. But one could say it is alive in the way an old tree is: hollow at its core, standing mostly on memory and habit. The creation of CCD is not a sign of strength. It is a sign that those in power too have lost faith in the idea that law can deliver justice. And if the state itself stops believing in justice, then who will?
